# Capital Asset Pricing Model theory

## Capital asset pricing model is given by

$\mathbb{E[r_a]} = r_f + \beta_a(\mathbb{E[r_m]} - r_f)$

Where,
- $\mathbb{E[r_a]}$ : Expected return of an investment.(Could be a stock or a portfolio)

- $r_f$: Base return(Risk free interest rate)

- $\beta_a(\mathbb{E[r_m]} - r_f)$ : Market excess return


### Beta is given by

$\beta_a = \frac{\mathrm{Cov(r_a, r_m)}}{\mathrm{Var(r_m)}}$

Beta parameter measures the stock's relative volatility, aka how much the price of the given stock goes up/ down compared to that of the whole market.
