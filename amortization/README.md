# Amortization

Amortization is defined as periodic payments. It is calculated using the following formula:

$P = \frac{\frac{r}{n}(1+\frac{r}{n})^mV(0)}{(1+\frac{r}{n})^m - 1} $ 

Where:
1. $P$ : Periodic Payment
1. $r$ : Interest rate (Absolute percent, for example: 0.13 if interest is 13%)
1. $m$ : Number of periods
1. $V(0)$ : Principal amount
1. $n$: Frequency of interest
